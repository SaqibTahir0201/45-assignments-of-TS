//? 1. Install Node.js, TypeScript and VS Code on your computer.
// ~ DONE

//* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//? 2. Personal Message: Store a person’s name in a variable, and print a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?”

var person = "Maaz";
console.log(`Hello ${person}, would you like to learn some Javascript today?`);

//* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//? 3. Name Cases: Store a person’s name in a variable, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and Title_case.
var personName = "Maaz";

console.log(personName.toLocaleLowerCase());
console.log(personName.toUpperCase());

//* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//? 4. Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:

var quote = "“Win or lose, I always learn something”";
console.log("Andrew Tate's motto" +" "+ quote);

//* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//? 5.Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 4, but this time store the famous person’s name in a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message.

var famousPerson = "Andrew Tate";
var message = "“Believe you can and you're halfway there..”"
console.log(`message for my favorite person ${famousPerson} that ${message}` );

//* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//? 6. Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces

var personName = "\t Abu Andrew Tate \n";
//# Print the name with whitespace
console.log("Name with whitespace: " + personName);

//# Strip the whitespace
console.log("Name without whitespace: " + personName.trim());
//* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//?  7. Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results.
//? 8. You should create four lines that look like this:
//# ADDITION
console.log(2 + 3);

//*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//?10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

 var myName = "Abdul Rehman";
 var date = "1st March 2024";

 console.log(`my name is ${myName} and today date is ${date}`);

//# in question 10 i make 2 variables and give values to them then i use consoloe.log() which use to print the values in the browser console . in Round Brackets / Parentheses i use backticks `` which print value as a string . then i use ${} to print the store value...
//! IMPORTANT NOTE => EVERYTHING I WRITE IN QUESTION 10 WILL NOT SHOW IN A BROWSER console AS I USE COMMENTS THAT BROWSER DOESN'T EXECUTE

    `this is the last invitation message finally 😅 \n please ${guests[i]} come to the dinner`
  );
}
//*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//? 17. Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests.
//# Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.

console.log(
  `sorry to inform you that i can invite only two people for dinner.`
);
//# Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.

 console.log(locations);

// //? Print your array in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list.

 locations.sort();
 console.log
//*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//? 20. Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else you’d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

var random = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"];

console.log(random);

let indexError = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];

console.log(indexError[5]);

//*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// //?23. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
//# let car = 'subaru';
//# console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
//# console.log(car == 'subaru')
//# Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

//? 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

//? 44. Sandwiches: Write a function that accepts a array of items a person wants on a sandwich. The function should have one parameter that collects as many items as the function call provides, and it should print a summary of the sandwich that is being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different number of arguments each time.

 let Sandwiches = (names) => {
   for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
     Sandwiches = prompt("order your sandwiches");
     console.log(Sandwiches);

//?45. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature.  Print the Object that’s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

let makeCar = (manufacturer, model, color = "white", features = []) => {
  return {
    manufacturer: manufacturer,
    model: model,
    color: color,
    features: features
  };
};

let car1 = makeCar("Toyota", "Corolla", "red", ["Bluetooth", "USB"]);
console.log(car1);

let car2 = makeCar("BMW", "X5", "black", ["Navigation", "Leather Seats"]);
console.log(car2);
